{"name":"Musa","tagline":"Middleware for User-driven Self-Adaptation ","body":"The traditional workflow approach (BPEL) is not easy to extend for supporting some advanced features as, for example: run-time modification of the flow of events, dynamic hierarchies of services, integration of user preferences. Moreover, it is not easy to provide a system for run-time monitoring of activities that is also able of dealing with unexpected failures and optimization.\r\n\r\nMUSA is based on decoupling the sub-components of a service (breaking the static constraints of a classic workflow model) could improve its understandability and evolvability.\r\n\r\nMUSA mixes the following ingredients:\r\n* goal-orientation for making user-requirements explicit in the system thus breaking the strict coupling among activities of the workflow;\r\n* autonomic computing and self-adaptation, for generating smart and dynamic plans as response to user-requests and to unpredictable events of the environment.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
