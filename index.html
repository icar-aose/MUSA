        <p>The traditional workflow approach (BPEL) is not easy to extend for supporting some advanced features as, for example: run-time modification of the flow of events, dynamic hierarchies of services, integration of user preferences. Moreover, it is not easy to provide a system for run-time monitoring of activities that is also able of dealing with unexpected failures and optimization.</p>

<p>MUSA is based on decoupling the sub-components of a service (breaking the static constraints of a classic workflow model) could improve its understandability and evolvability.</p>

<p>MUSA mixes the following ingredients:</p>

<ul>
<li>goal-orientation for making user-requirements explicit in the system thus breaking the strict coupling among activities of the workflow;</li>
<li>autonomic computing and self-adaptation, for generating smart and dynamic plans as response to user-requests and to unpredictable events of the environment.</li>
</ul>
